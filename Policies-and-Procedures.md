# Winternship Policies and Procedures

If you have questions or concerns prior to and/or during your Winternship:
 - If you have a question about the overall Winternship program at any time: contact witny@cornell.edu, or reach out to us on Slack
 - If you have a question specific to your Winternship company (for example, the exact location, your on-boarding paperwork, etc.): contact your Winternship company
 - **At any time during your Winternship, if you have a concern about the safety or comfort of yourself or your team, contact witny@cornell.edu**

During your Winternship:
 - Because the Winternship is only a three week experience, **you’re expected to be at your Winternship company for the entire day that you are scheduled to work.**
 - In case of an emergency (i.e. sickness, family issue, etc.) where you will need to miss any work (even 30 minutes of work or less), immediately contact your Winternship company
 - Work hours can be adjusted for religious observances. If this applies to you, contact your Winternship company right away to make them aware and adjust your hours.
 - If there are other reasons you anticipate needing to adjust your work schedule, contact: WiTNY first at witny@cornell.edu, or reach out to us on Slack.
 - If you’re going to be late, even by a minute, for work: contact your Winternship company the moment you realize this and/or you have phone service.

**Failure to attend work for an unexcused reason, being consistently late, or not showing up without notifying someone can result in you being removed from the Winternship program.**
