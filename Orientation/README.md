# Winternship 2020 Orientation

### [Challenge Project](Challenge%20Project/)
Your Winternship project is very different from a team project you might have experienced in class, and this session will walk you through how to think through it. You’ll work with your peers to go through a practice problem process, from ideation to iterating to a solution. 

### [HR Processes](HR%20Processes/)
Onboarding at a new company is a maze of acronyms and forms, and we’re here to help you figure it out! Practice filling out W-4 forms, be prepared for common onboarding tasks, and learn who to contact when you don’t know what to do.

### [Operating in the Professional Environment](Operating%20in%20the%20Professional%20Envionment/)
Learn the “ins and outs” of navigating a professional office environment. You’ll leave prepared to tackle communications, successfully get through meetings, and read an office culture like a favorite book.

### [Presentations 101](Presentations%20101/README.md)
Did you know that 75% of people have some fear of public speaking? This session will go over some great tips for making the most of your project presentation and give everyone the opportunity to practice their presentation skills.

### [Work Personalities and Teamwork](Work%20Personalities%20and%20Teamwork/)
Have you thought about how you work? Are team projects your worst nightmare? This session will walk you though how to identify your own working style, and give you skills to collaborate effectively with others who don’t share your “work personality”.

### [Winternship Expectations and Goalsetting](Winternship%20Expectations%20and%20Goalsetting/)
The key to making the most of your Winternship experience is knowing what you’re going to do, and how it fits into your larger career goals. We’ll work with each other to help identify what it is we want to learn from Winternships, and the step by step process to getting there.
